\section{Proposed system}
The proposed system is made of a system in two parts. The first part is the client, running on a regular computer, the second part is a server running on a centralised computer, available to all running clients through the internet.
\subsection{Functional requirements}
The calendar system supports one actor - the user.
\subsection{Nonfunctional requirements}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | l | p{10cm} |}
    \hline
    Category & Nonfunctional requirements \\ \hline
    Usability & The UI of the client must resemble a paper calendar, as to ease learning process.\\ \hline
    Reliability & Loss of connection to the server must only cut off functions requiring connection, but not access to information already loaded.\\ \hline
    Performance & \tabitem The server must support multiple clients at once (e.g., 25). \\
    \mbox{} & \tabitem The communication between client and server, when updating a server should be fast even with a low bandwidth connection. \\ \hline
	Supportability & ... \\ \hline
	Implementation & The system should be implemented in C\# and work on all newer versions of Windows \\ \hline
	Operation & ... \\ \hline
	Legal & ... \\ \hline

\subsection{System models}

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\textbf{Scenario name:} Create entry
\\
\textbf{Participating actors:} John (user)
\\
\textbf{Flow of events:}
\begin{itemize}
\item John is invited to meeting the 21st of July 2015. To remember it he wants to make an entry in his calendar. He accesses the create new entry function in the calendar system.
\item John plots the information of the meeting and the date/time. He confirms the input and waits for the calendar to create the entry.
\item The calendar system tells John that the entry has successfully been created.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Scenario name:} Create account
\\
\textbf{Participating actors:} Alice (user)
\\
\textbf{Flow of events:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Alice has a lot of appointments, so she wants to create an account to the calendar system. She accesses the createUser function in the calendar system.
\item Alice plots in all required information (for example login information and name). She then confirms the information and wait for the system to confirm the creation of her account.
\item The calendar system confirms the notify Alice that her account has been successfully created.
\end{itemize}

    \mbox{} & \tabitem The User confirms input in the entry. \\
    \mbox{} & \tabitem The system confirms entry has been created. \\
    \mbox{} & \tabitem The system sends a notice to all added Users (Include use case NotifyUser). \\ \hline
    Entry condition & The User creating the entry is logged in to the CalendarSystem \\ \hline
    Exit condition & Entry has been created \\
	\mbox{} & A notice has been sent to all added Users \\
	\hline
