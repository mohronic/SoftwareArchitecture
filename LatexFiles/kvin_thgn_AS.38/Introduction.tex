\section{Introduction}
The purpose of the calendar system is to make a calendar system for a workplace, capable of sharing entries and organizing meetings etc.
\subsection{Scope of the system}
The system is intended to be used in a workplace environment, where people know each other, or at least are acquainted in some way. Thus the program has no need for contact lists and blocking of people, since it is used by people working together, to organize meetings etc.
\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}
The objective is to implement a sytem that is easy to use and learn for the user. As the system is supposed to replace the paper calendar it should also be quick to create to update entries.

The criteria for this is:
\begin{itemize}
\item In a user test 70\% of participants must be able to use all of the functions in the system available to them within an hour.
\item In a user test 65\% of participants must be able to create an entry in their calendar in under one minute.
\item From the time an user confirms the creation or update of an entry, the system may at most use 5 seconds to complete the request.
\end{itemize}
