\section{Proposed software architecture}
\subsection{Overview}
The following chapter will go through: the chosen architecture patterns and design of the calendar system, the design patterns used to implement it and how the control flow of the program.
\subsection{Subsystem decomposition}
The figure below shows the subsystem decomposition of the User part of the program.
