The purpose of the calendar system is replace the paper calendar with an online calendar available for user through a client on a computer. 
\subsection{Scope of the system}
The calendar will allow users to access their calendar from any computer with the client installed and an internet connection, since their calendar is bound to an account. Users will be able to create and manage entries in their calendar and share entries with other users.
\subsection{Objectives and success criteria of the project}
The objective is to implement a easy to use, and learn, system, for the user. The system should also be fast to create/update entries.

The criteria for this is:
\begin{itemize}
\item In a user test 70\% of participants must be able to use all of the functions in the system available to them within an hour.
\item In a user test 65\% of participants must be able to create an entry in their calendar in under one minute.
\item From the time an user confirms the creation/update of an entry, the system may at most use 5 seconds to complete the request.
\end{itemize}
