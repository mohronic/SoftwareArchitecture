\section{Current system}
The currents system used is a physical calendar made of paper. The problem with this system is the need to change the calendar every year. The current system also requires the users to bring the calendar with them between destinations, since the calendar is not available through other means. It is also bothersome to share entries with other people, as this must be done with a phone or over email.
